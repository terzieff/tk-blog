Tomasz. Based in Łódź, Poland. Interested in music, data and the world.

I do data/internetz stuff at [Bluerank](https://www.bluerank.pl/), host a radio show at the [best students' radio station](http://www.zak.lodz.pl/) and coordinate [a local meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/data-science-lodz/) dealing with data science.

I code mostly in [R](https://www.r-project.org/).
