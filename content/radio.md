Żak is one of the coolest places on Earth and certainly the coolest radio station. They let me host [a weekly radio show there](http://www.zak.lodz.pl/audycja/Piosennik), which airs on Sundays between 11 PM and midnight CET. It’s called "Piosennik" - a portmanteau that comes from Polish words "piosenka" (a song) and "sennik" (a dream journal). I think I’ll post my playlists here. And some charts with data from these playlists - that seems reasonable, I guess.
